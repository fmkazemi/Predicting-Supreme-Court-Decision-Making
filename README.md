Predicting Supreme Court Decision Making, NLP

# Overview
In this project, we create data from past legal cases that have been resolved by the courts. We use that data to predict the outcomes of cases that might come before the courts in the future. We'd like to approach this problem.

First, I'm attaching an example of a redacted and reduced dataset containing ~1500 cases and ~15 variables of interest that we have coded by hand. The classification problem we have here is a binary classification problem -- the two possible outcomes are liable or not liable -- and we would like to classify the outcome of future cases.

Second, I'm including links to five recent cases in a different area of law. (There are many more cases in the universe.) Here, we want to classify whether a court will classify a worker as an employee or an independent contractor. The five cases should give you a flavour of the raw, unstructured data that we begin with. We'd like to approach this problem through NLP and LSTM.
